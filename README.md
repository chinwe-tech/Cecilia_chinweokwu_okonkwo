This project analyzes **sales performance over time** using an **Area Chart** visualization.  
The data covers the years **2014 to 2017**, showing how sales evolved and the percentage contributions across categories.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives
- Track overall sales performance across four years.  
- Compare category contributions to total sales.  
- Identify growth and decline periods in the business cycle.  
- Provide visual insights using an **area chart**.

The area chart shows:  
- **2014** had the highest sales volume.  
- Sales declined sharply in **2015**, recovered slightly in **2016**, and dropped again in **2017**.  
- Each colored section represents different category contributions with their percentage shares labeled.

## 📈 Key Insights
- **2014 Peak:** Sales were strongest in 2014, making up the largest share (over 24k units).  
- **2015 Decline:** Significant drop in sales, with some categories losing almost half their share.  
- **2016 Recovery:** Partial rebound in sales, though not reaching 2014 levels.  
- **2017 Low Point:** Sales declined further, closing at the lowest point in the four-year period.  

Category contributions (by % across years):  
- Blue Area: Declined from **19.77%** in 2014 to **2.56%** in 2017.  
- Red Area: Dropped from **8.33%** in 2014 to **3.94%** in 2017.  
- Orange Area: Fluctuated, peaking at **19.88%** in 2015 before dropping to **2.80%** in 2017.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Explore **why 2014 sales peaked** (seasonality, promotions, economic factors?).  
- Analyze **customer demographics** for deeper segmentation.  
- Compare sales with **profit margins** to understand true performance.  
- Extend analysis to **2018 and beyond** for recent trends.
